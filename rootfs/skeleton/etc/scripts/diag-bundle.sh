# diag-bundle.sh [--full] [OUT] -- collect what a bug report about this
# stick needs into one tar.gz, with every secret redacted and the identity
# of the stick masked. The web UI serves it as GET /api/diag (odi-ui confd
# runs this and streams OUT); it is as usable from a shell:
#
#     /etc/scripts/diag-bundle.sh /tmp/odi-diag.tar.gz
#
# OUT defaults to /tmp/odi-diag.tar.gz. On success the last line on stdout
# is OUT and the exit status is 0; on failure OUT is removed and the status
# is 1. Busybox only.
#
# What goes in, under odi-diag/ in the archive: the previous boot ramlog
# (/proc/odi_ramlog_prev), /var/log/*, dmesg, /etc/odi-build, /etc/version,
# the readable /proc/odi_wdt files, uptime, /proc/meminfo, /proc/mounts,
# /proc/cmdline, ps, the U-Boot slot variables from both environment copies
# (nv getenv and nv fallback), a scrape of the exporter, the config store
# (lastgood.xml, lastgood_hs.xml, odi.conf) with every secret value
# replaced by REDACTED, and under pon/ the GPON and OMCI state: diag (ONU
# state, alarms, GEM flows, port counters, the PON queue registers that
# cmd 23 and 25 write), /proc/odi_gpon, /proc/odi_omci, and omcli (state,
# provision, flows, tcont, conn, and the MIB classes in OMCI_CLASSES), and
# under module/ the optics module on /dev/i2c-0: A0h whole (a0.txt), A2h
# with the page select as found (a2.txt), and in chip.txt the page select,
# the laser driver identity (A2h page 2 byte 0xa0, 0x6a for a GN25L95;
# bytes 0x80 and 0xdc, the UX3320 variant markers) and the UX3320
# INIT_STATE (page 3 byte 0xf0), with the upper half of every page in
# I2C_PAGES that could be selected (a2-p<N>.txt). Selecting a page is the
# one write the bundle makes anywhere; the page found is put back and read
# back, and chip.txt records both. MANIFEST.txt lists each step, its exit
# status and its size.
#
# What is redacted, in the config copies: the keys in SECRET_KEYS below,
# and any key whose name contains one of the words in SECRET_WORDS. An empty
# value stays empty, so "not set" is still visible. Then every non-empty
# secret value found -- those keys, plus the web UI password from
# /etc/config/confd.auth -- is scrubbed from EVERY file in the bundle, as
# text, as hex and as space-separated hex, in case a log quoted one. A value
# shorter than SHORT_LEN is scrubbed only where it stands as a whole token,
# so a USER_PASSWORD of "user" does not turn userland_ok into REDACTEDland_ok.
# confd.auth, the dropbear keys and /etc/passwd are never collected at all.
#
# What is masked: the serial number, the MACs, the LOID and the module
# serial (IDENT_KEYS, the serial in /proc/odi_gpon, the interface MACs, A0h
# bytes 68-83, which are also blanked in module/a0.txt). Many OLTs authenticate by
# serial number alone, so a bundle posted in a public issue would otherwise
# hand out what it takes to clone the line. Each is replaced, in every file
# and in every spelling (text, hex, MAC with and without separators), by
# MASKED- and its last four characters, which still tells two sticks apart.
# --full keeps them, for a bundle shared privately; the web UI never passes
# it. The PLOAM ring in /proc/odi_gpon prints message bodies, so the bodies
# that carry the password or a key fragment are always withheld, and those
# that carry the serial number unless --full: what is left of a value cut
# by the ten-byte window would escape the scrub.
#
# The MIB classes are a list on purpose, not the whole MIB: an OLT can push
# credentials through OMCI (SIP user data, authentication methods, large
# strings, the TR-069 server), and none of that is in the classes below.
#
# Every step is bounded: a command through busybox timeout (STEP_TIMEOUT_S
# each, METRICS_TIMEOUT_S for the exporter scrape, which runs diag and
# omcicli behind it with bounds of their own of 3 s and 2 s), a log file by
# LOG_FILE_MAX bytes and all of /var/log together by LOG_TOTAL_MAX, and the
# archive by BUNDLE_MAX, past which it is refused rather than served. When
# omcid does not answer omcli state, the other omcli steps are skipped, so a
# hung omcid costs one timeout rather than one per step. Each i2c command
# has its own STEP_TIMEOUT_S, and the first failure among the page selects
# ends them and goes to the restore.
