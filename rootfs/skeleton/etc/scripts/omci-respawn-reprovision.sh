# omci-respawn-reprovision.sh -- run in the background by svc-omcid.sh
# whenever init has just respawned omcid (not the first start of this
# boot). See docs/BOOT.md, "Respawn re-provisioning" and "Resume without
# re-registration": omcid respawns and serves omcicli again within seconds
# of a kill; whether the OLT has to be forced through a fresh
# identification cycle to notice depends on whether the respawned omcid
# resumed its MIB from the snapshot it kept in /var/run, or came up empty.
#
# The respawned omcid itself decides that (docs/BOOT.md), and says so by
# writing $RESUME_DECISION before doing anything else that could block:
# "resumed" (it loaded a valid snapshot while the PON was still O5 and
# needs nothing from this script -- the datapath was never touched) or
# "reprovision" (no snapshot, a mismatched device, not O5, or a MIB the OLT
# has since reset). This script waits, briefly, for that decision, then
# either exits or forces the OLT to re-range and re-provision -- deactivate,
# wait for the (already respawned) omcid to register, re-apply the PLOAM
# password, hold, reactivate (rcs-lib.sh's omci_reactivate) --
# without touching the omcid process itself: init is already supervising
# it as a respawn entry, so killing or starting one from here would only
# trigger another respawn, and another run of this script.
