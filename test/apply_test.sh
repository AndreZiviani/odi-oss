# apply.sh omci sends SIGHUP to the running omcid and reads the outcome from
# the status file omcid writes. omcid here is a stub that traps SIGHUP and
# writes the file the way src/omci/respond/reload.c does (its real behaviour
# is src/omci/reload-test.sh). What is checked is the script: it never starts
# an omcid, never touches the driver, sends the signal to the pid pidof
# names, waits for a NEW run (a stale status file answers nothing), reports
# each outcome, and is bounded when the daemon is silent or slow.
