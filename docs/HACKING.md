# Hacking on odi-oss

For a developer who has never seen this project and wants to change it.
The rest of the docs describe the firmware as a user sees it; this one is
about how it is built, how it is kept from bricking a stick, how it is
tested, and which traps have already cost someone a day. Where another
document already says something well, this one links to it rather than
repeating it. Two things are complete here and nowhere else: the recovery
mechanism ([Recovery](#the-recovery-mechanism)) and the list of traps
([Gotchas](#gotchas)). [Feature toggles](#feature-toggles) is the
developer reference for every switch, parameter and build variable.

[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) holds the house rules in short form. Read it
too; nothing here overrides it.

### What the image is

A complete replacement firmware for the **ODI DFP-34X-2C2**, a GPON ONU in
an SFP stick: Linux **6.18** (the current longterm line), our own drivers
for the switch, the GPON MAC, the CPU-port NIC and the OMCI transport, our
own userland daemons and CLIs, and our own gcc/binutils/uClibc-ng
toolchain. Nothing proprietary is shipped or linked. The stock firmware
(Linux 2.6.30, closed) normally stays in the other boot slot.

| | |
|---|---|
| SoC | Realtek RTL9602C (the die; marketed as RTL9601D, [`docs/kb/rtl9602c-chip-identity.md`](kb/rtl9602c-chip-identity.md)) |
| CPU | Lexra RLX5281: MIPS-I plus a few MIPS-II instructions, big-endian, no FPU, R3000-style exceptions and caches |
| RAM / flash | 32 MB DRAM / 8 MB SPI NOR |
| ports | one UNI (the SFP edge, SerDes to the host), the PON, and the CPU port (the stick's own IP stack) |
| console | a UART on the board, no connector: in practice, no serial console |
| boot | U-Boot, two kernel+rootfs slots, a one-shot trial boot, a hardware watchdog |

The flash map comes from the `mtdparts=` table U-Boot passes (and the
fallback in `kernel/618/config`): `boot` 256K, `env` and `env2` 8K each,
`config` 240K (jffs2, shared by both slots), `k0` 1328K, `r0` 2512K, `k1`
1328K, `r1` 2512K. Slot 0 boots with `root=31:5`, slot 1 with `root=31:7`.

### The boot, in one paragraph

U-Boot picks a slot ([below](#the-recovery-mechanism)), decompresses the
LZMA uImage and jumps to `kernel_entry` with a per-slot command line in
`argv`. The board code (`kernel/extra/arch/mips/rtl8686/`) stops the NIC DMA
the loader left running, installs the RLX5281 cache code, reserves the PON
DMA windows and the two ramlog pages, and the drivers under
`kernel/extra/drivers/net/ethernet/odi/` come up built in (there are no
modules). `/etc/init.d/rcS` then mounts the config partition, writes the
switch SDK-init verbs to `/proc/odi_init`, brings up `br0` with
`/etc/scripts/network.sh`, starts `services` (metricsd, confd, dropbear) in
the background, **confirms userland to the watchdog**, drives the optics,
and runs the PON steps, which start `omcid` and activate the GPON MAC.
`docs/BOOT.md` has each stage and why it is where it is;
`/etc/init.d/rcS.dev` adds the development aids.

### Where to start reading

- **Kernel or drivers**: `docs/KERNEL.md` end to end, then
  `kernel/extra/drivers/net/ethernet/odi/README.md`, then the driver you
  care about and its host test in `test/`.
- **Boot and userland**: `rootfs/skeleton/etc/init.d/rcS` with
  `docs/BOOT.md`, then `rcS.dev`, `docs/TOOLS.md`, `docs/SETTINGS.md`.
- **OMCI**: `src/omci/README.md`, `docs/REFERENCES.md` for the ITU-T
  specs (`tools/fetch-refs.sh` fetches them), and the OMCI notes in
  `docs/kb/`.
- **A tool of your own on the stick**: `docs/CROSS-COMPILING.md`.

## Building

`docs/BUILDING.md` is the full reference; this is the working summary.

### Prerequisites

Docker, bash, GNU make, git, `curl`, `xz`, `gpg` and `shasum` (the kernel
fetch), and for the host tests a C compiler, Python 3 and `shellcheck`.
`make releases` downloads public releases with `gh` when installed, or
`curl` otherwise; no login or token is required
([confd and metricsd](#confd-and-metricsd)).
Everything that compiles for the target runs in containers. The toolchains
are prebuilt images, pinned by digest in `toolchain/images.env` and pulled
on first use ([Toolchain images](#toolchain-images)). The uclibc one is
`amd64`: on Apple silicon or any other non-x86_64 host it runs under
emulation, which is slow for the kernel. Use a remote build host
([below](#remote-builds)).

### Toolchain images

Both come from the odi-toolchain repository
(<https://github.com/AndreZiviani/odi-toolchain>), which builds and
publishes them; `toolchain/README.md` has what each contains. Nothing here
builds a compiler any more.

The packages are public: no login is needed. A failed pull says so and
prints the fallback: build the images from source in the odi-toolchain
repository and export `OSS_IMAGE=odi-toolchain-uclibc:local` /
`DIAG_IMAGE=odi-toolchain-freestanding:local`.

To move a pin: tag a new version in odi-toolchain, take the digest from its
publish run, change `toolchain/images.env`, rebuild, and compare the image
file by file against one built with the old pin.

### From a clean clone

    git clone git@github.com:AndreZiviani/odi-oss.git && cd odi-oss
    make image-all                 # out/image/<version>.tar, a few minutes on an 8-core x86_64 host

The toolchain images bring their own kernel headers, so `kernel-tree` no
longer gates them; `image-all` still runs it first, since `kernel` needs
it. `make image-all` runs, in order: `kernel-tree` (fetch and verify
linux-6.18.53, pack it into `build/kernel-618/tree.tar`), `toolchain` (pull
the two pinned images, under a minute), `toolchain-audit`, `kernel`
(2 min), `packages`, `src`, `releases`, `image`. After the first build
every target skips work it has already done; a second `make image-all`
takes about a minute. `docs/BUILDING.md` has the per-step timings.

### Targets

| target | what | output |
|---|---|---|
| `make kernel-tree` | `kernel/tree.sh`: fetch (`kernel/618/fetch.sh`) and pack the pristine tree; run by `kernel` (the toolchain is prebuilt and no longer needs it) | `kernel/618/mainline`, `build/kernel-618/tree.tar` |
| `make toolchain` / `toolchain-audit` | pull the pinned toolchain images; the audit re-proves the uclibc target libraries carry no instruction this CPU traps on | the images in `toolchain/images.env` |
| `make kernel` | `kernel/build.sh` | `build/kernel-618/{uImage,vmlinux,System.map,config}` |
| `make busybox`, `make packages` | busybox, then dropbear and iproute2, static, ISA-audited | `out/` |
| `make src` | our freestanding binaries | `out/bin/` |
| `make releases` | `src/fetch-releases.sh` | `out/bin/{metricsd,confd}`, `out/confd-assets/` |
| `make image` | `image/build.sh` (runs `make src` first; names every other missing input and stops) | `out/image/<version>.tar`, `root-password-<version>.txt` |
| `make image-all` | all of the above, in order, from a clean clone | |
| `make test` | `lint`, `test-host`, `test-diag`, `test-omci` | [Testing](#testing) |
| `make clean` / `distclean` | `build/` and `out/`; also the kernel tree and `dl/` | the Docker volumes survive both |

### Docker volumes and images

| name | kind | what |
|---|---|---|
| `odi-kbuild-618` | volume | the kernel build tree (`VOL=`); incremental between runs |
| `odi-toolchain-uclibc` | image | the uclibc-ng toolchain at `/opt/oss` and the kernel and package build container (`OSS_IMAGE=`, `packages/oss-env.sh`); pinned in `toolchain/images.env` |
| `odi-toolchain-freestanding` | image | Debian `gcc-mips-linux-gnu` plus `qemu-mips-static`: builds `src/`, runs `test-diag` and `test-omci` (`DIAG_IMAGE=`); pinned in `toolchain/images.env` |
| `odi-oss-image` | image | squashfs and tar tooling for `image/build.sh` |

`docker volume rm odi-kbuild-618` is the only way to drop the volume;
nothing in the tree depends on its exact contents. Every name in the table
has an override (`VOL`, `OSS_IMAGE`, `DIAG_IMAGE`, `TOOLS_IMAGE`), so two
builds on one Docker host can share nothing: `docs/BUILDING.md`, "Several
builds on one Docker host".

### Remote builds

    ODI_REMOTE=user@buildhost tools/remote-build.sh 'make image-all'

rsyncs the working tree (tracked and untracked, so uncommitted changes
build), runs the command there, and copies `out/image/*.tar`, the password
files and build logs back. `ODI_REMOTE` has no default; `ODI_REMOTE_DIR`
defaults to `/root/odi/odi-oss`. The kernel tree and `dl/` are excluded
from the sync (the tree is gigabytes); the first build on the remote host
fetches them. `make releases` needs no token there either; an optional
`GITHUB_TOKEN`, if you want the higher rate limit, is passed to the remote
command on stdin. The command is any shell line, so
`'VERSION=odi-oss-260925-mine make kernel image'` works too.

### Iterating

- **Kernel**: an edit to an overlay file rebuilds incrementally. Adding or
  removing an overlay file, or changing a patch, the seed config or
  `kernel/build.sh`, re-extracts the tree. `FRESH=1` forces that.
  `COMPILE_ONLY=1` stops at `vmlinux` (no uImage), for disassembly checks.
- **Image**: `KERNEL=` and `KCONFIG=` point `image/build.sh` at a kernel
  built elsewhere; `VERSION=` names the build (and should match the
  `VERSION=` the kernel was built with, so the ramlog build id matches the
  image); `ALLOW_PARTIAL=1` builds without an optional package or confd
  assets. [Feature toggles](#build-variables) has every variable.
- **The root password** is generated per build and written to
  `out/image/root-password-<version>.txt`; `ROOT_PW=` chooses it,
  `ROOT_PW=none` leaves it empty, `ROOT_PW=locked` ships no password at all
  and starts dropbear with `-s` (`.github/workflows/release.yml` builds
  every release this way). It is baked into the read-only rootfs, so keep
  the file for as long as that image runs anywhere. All three shapes are
  `image/gen-root-account.sh`, tested by `test/root_pw_test.sh`.

### confd and metricsd

The web UI (`confd`, the odi-ui project) and the Prometheus exporter
(`metricsd`, the odi-sfp-exporter project) are separate repositories with their
own releases. `src/fetch-releases.sh` downloads the pinned tags
(`CONFD_TAG`, `METRICSD_TAG`; the defaults are in the script) with `gh`
when it is installed and logged in, otherwise with `curl` (`USE_CURL=1`
forces it); both repos are public, so neither path needs a token, verifies
each asset against the release's `SHA256SUMS`, caches them in
`dl/releases/`, and records the tags in `out/bin/releases.env`, which
`image/build.sh` copies into `/etc/odi-build`.

To ship a **local confd build**, set `CONFD_TAG` to the empty string and
point `CONFD_BIN` at the binary; its web assets are taken from `web/` and
`schema/` in the parent of the binary's directory (`odi-ui/build/confd`
means `odi-ui/`), or from the checkout `CONFD_ASSETS=` names:

    CONFD_TAG= CONFD_BIN=../odi-ui/build/confd make releases image

confd reads `/etc/confd/` for the whole UI and its `.tsv` tables; a confd
without them starts and answers 404 to everything, so check the "asset
files" line the script prints. A UI change that adds a setting has to land
in odi-ui `schema/settings.tsv` and `docs/SETTINGS.md` together.

### What CI runs

`.github/workflows/ci.yml`: on pull requests and pushes to `main`, `make
lint`, `make test-host`, `make test-diag` and `make test-omci`. On release
tags (`v*`, `odi-oss-*`) and manual runs it adds `make src` on its own. The
toolchain, kernel and image are **not** built in CI: 25 minutes of compiling
and nothing in them runs without a stick. Build the kernel yourself before
you push a kernel change.

`.github/workflows/release.yml`, on a `v*` tag only, does build the full
image (`VERSION=` from the tag, `ROOT_PW=locked`) and publishes it as a
GitHub release: the tarball, `SHA256SUMS`, and notes from
`tools/release-notes.sh` (the tag's own `CHANGELOG.md` section plus a
flash-and-first-login paragraph).

## The recovery mechanism

Everything about working on this device rests on one fact: **a new image is
only ever booted once, on trial, and any failure puts the stick back on the
image that was already trusted.** Understand this section before flashing
anything. The user-facing procedure is `docs/FLASHING.md`; this is the
mechanism behind it.

### Two slots and three variables

Each slot is a kernel partition and a rootfs partition (`k0`/`r0`,
`k1`/`r1`). The config partition is shared. The U-Boot environment (`env`,
with a redundant copy in `env2`, read and written by our `nv`) decides
which slot boots:

| variable | meaning |
|---|---|
| `sw_commit` | the trusted slot: every ordinary boot goes here |
| `sw_tryactive` | `0` or `1`: boot that slot **once**; `2`: no trial pending |
| `sw_active` | U-Boot's record of what it last booted; never set it by hand |

`bootcmd` is (read off a stick with `nv getenv`; the full text is in
[`docs/kb/rtl9601-uboot-trial-boot.md`](kb/rtl9601-uboot-trial-boot.md)):

    bootcmd           = if sw_tryactive == 2; then boot_by_commit; else boot_by_tryactive; fi
    boot_by_commit    = boot the slot named by sw_commit
    boot_by_tryactive = setenv sw_tryactive 2; setenv sw_active <n>; saveenv; run en_wdt; boot slot <n>

The trial path writes `sw_tryactive` back to `2` and saves **before** it
arms the watchdog and jumps, so a trial cannot loop: whatever happens
next, the following boot takes `boot_by_commit`. Only `0` is tested for
slot 0; any other value that is not `2` boots slot 1, so write `0` or `1`
and nothing else.

### What sends a trial back

| event during a trial | next boot |
|---|---|
| kernel panics, hangs, never mounts root | the watchdog U-Boot armed resets the board: committed slot |
| kernel alive, but rcS never confirms within 120 s of uptime | `odi_wdt` forces the reset: committed slot |
| `reboot`, `reboot -f`, the web UI's reboot | committed slot |
| power cycle | committed slot (and the ramlog is lost) |
| image confirms, then misbehaves (no network, no ssh) | **stays up** until you power-cycle it |

`reboot` resets at once: odi_wdt registers a restart handler that stops
the NIC DMA, then forces the watchdog reset (enable alone, then a kick;
the kick is what restarts the count), about 0.3 s. Reboot to the stock
image answering again is about 73 s, most of it U-Boot and the stock boot.
`halt` and `poweroff` do not stop the board: the stick has no power
switch, so the watchdog is re-armed and resets it about 42 s later
(docs/KERNEL.md, "Reboot, halt and power-off").

On a **committed** slot of ours the same watchdog and deadline are armed
(`odi_wdt` arms the watchdog itself on every boot, not only on trials), so
a hang there becomes a reboot loop on that slot. That is the cost of
committing an image you have not watched come up.

### The userland deadline

`odi_wdt.c` kicks the hardware watchdog from a kernel thread, so a kernel
that is merely alive would never be reset. It therefore also holds a
deadline: unless something writes `1` to
`/proc/odi_wdt/userland_ok` within `ODI_WDT_USERLAND_DEADLINE_S`
(120 s) of uptime, it stops the NIC DMA (`wdt_pre_reset_hook`) and forces
the reset itself. The directory was named after the stock firmware
(`luna_watchdog`) until a cleanup gave it our own name, once rcS no longer
needed to share a line with the stock image.

rcS writes it (`rootfs/skeleton/etc/init.d/rcS`, "the watchdog
confirmation") after the SDK-init verbs, networking and the `services` launch, and
**before** the optics and the PON steps. The confirmation does not look at
the network: a trial whose management path never comes up stays up, and
you power-cycle it. For development there is
`/etc/config/confirm-arp` (read by `rcS.dev`): with it, rcS confirms only after an ARP reply
from the `.2` address of the `br0` subnet, so an unreachable trial reverts
by itself **and keeps its ramlog** (a watchdog reset preserves DRAM; a
power cycle does not). Never leave `confirm-arp` on a stick whose host is
not on `.2`: every boot then resets at 120 s. The confirmation and the
deadline are one mechanism; change neither without reading `rcS`,
`rcS.dev` and `odi_wdt.c` together.

This one-shot boot deadline is one of three independent rules odi_wdt
enforces after boot too -- a per-client ping deadline (omcid pings its own
60 s deadline from its own main loop, `/proc/odi_wdt/ping`) and a
kernel-side `MemAvailable` floor -- `docs/SETTINGS.md`, "Watchdog rules"
has the full design and why a v1.0.2 userland version of the second rule
was withdrawn.

### Never `sw_commit` a trial

`sw_commit` is the only thing that makes an image permanent, and writing it
throws away the fallback. Write it only from the running trial image, after
you have watched it work, by hand, and never from a script, a boot loop or
a soak: every trial boot is its own `nv setenv sw_tryactive <slot>`. A slot
can be re-tried any number of times without reflashing.

Two further facts:

- **Something other than you can move `sw_commit`.** On one stick it changed
  by itself about 80 s after a trial booted the stock image's management
  stack (an operator-driven OMCI software-image activate and commit). Our
  `omcid` never writes the boot environment, but read `sw_commit` back
  after every trial rather than assume it.
- **`fwu.sh` refuses to write the running slot or the slot `sw_commit`
  names** (in either environment copy), and the kernel's `mtdparts` marks
  the running pair read-only, so flashing the wrong slot takes more than one
  mistake. Check `sw_commit` equals the running slot before a trial anyway:
  a trial must revert *away* from the new image, not into it.

### Reading a boot you could not see

There is no serial console, so a trial that never answered is otherwise one
bit of information. Four records survive a revert:

- **The DRAM ramlog.** `odi_ramlog.c` mirrors every console line into two
  DRAM pages no kernel maps (`0x017ff000`: the first 4016 bytes and a
  64-byte per-boot metadata block; `0x01fff000`: a ring of the last 4080).
  They survive a watchdog reset or `reboot`, not a power cycle.
  - From **our** image (the next boot of ours), before its own ramlog
    writes: `cat /proc/odi_ramlog_prev` (decoded) or
    `/proc/odi_ramlog_prev_raw` (8192 bytes). The first two lines give this
    boot's counter and slot and the previous boot's counter, slot, build id
    and last early crumb: **check the slot and build id are the trial's**
    before reading on. It reaches one boot back; a stock boot in between
    writes nothing.
  - From the **stock** image: push `tools/memprobe` and run
    `tools/memprobe/ramlog-read.sh` ([`tools/memprobe/README.md`](../tools/memprobe/README.md)).
    Check `MemFree` first: pushing a file larger than free RAM into the
    stock image's ramfs has rebooted a stick.
- **Fatal-signal register dumps.** `print-fatal-signals=1` is on the
  built-in command line, so a process killed by SIGSEGV, SIGBUS or SIGILL
  prints `epc`, `ra`, `Status`, `Cause` and `BadVA` into the ramlog. That
  is how the loader's running NIC DMA was found (a page of `/bin/busybox`
  overwritten by an RX descriptor).
- **Early crumbs.** `CONFIG_ODI_EARLY_CRUMBS` stores a 4-byte tag and a
  step in page B at each board hook, from `K1EN` (first instruction) to
  `TICK` (timer interrupts counting): the last pair says how far a kernel
  got that died before its first console line. `CRUMBS_CORE=1` adds crumbs
  inside mainline's `head.S`, `start_kernel` and `cpu_probe`. The trail is
  in `docs/KERNEL.md` ("Early crumbs").
- **Boot breadcrumbs on flash.** `: > /etc/config/breadcrumbs.on`, set from
  the running image before the trial, makes rcS (through `rcS.dev`) append one timestamped line
  per stage to `/etc/config/breadcrumbs`, write a network snapshot to
  `/etc/config/trial-diag.txt`, log a heartbeat and lower the lockup
  thresholds. The config partition is shared and never written by
  `fwu.sh`, so read them from the image you land back on.

A trick for telling a timed event (a deadline, a watchdog) from a stalled
instruction: if the last line printed moves between otherwise identical
trials but the uptime at death does not, it is the timer, not the code at
that line ([`docs/kb/rtl9601-dram-ramlog-console.md`](kb/rtl9601-dram-ramlog-console.md)).

### When a stick seems bricked

In order:

1. **Wait two and a half minutes.** A hung trial resets at 120 s (the
   userland deadline), and the stock image then needs its own boot time.
2. **Power-cycle it.** With `sw_tryactive` already back at `2`, every boot
   after a trial is the committed slot. (This loses the ramlog; if the
   stick still answers ARP but not ssh, a reset that preserves DRAM is not
   available from outside, so take the loss.)
3. **Once it answers**, read `nv getenv` (`sw_commit`, `sw_tryactive`,
   `sw_active`), then the breadcrumbs and the ramlog as above.
4. **Up, but no service on the stock image?** The stock firmware runs a
   PON-mode detector: after about 24 s of light without PON sync it
   rewrites `PON_MODE` in the config store to the other PON type (GPON to
   EPON) and reboots, and it then looks dead on a GPON line. Anything that
   keeps the fibre lit while the stock image cannot sync can trigger it (a
   bench fibre, a fibre fault, an experiment that stops its OMCI stack),
   and no log survives the reboot to say so. `flash get
   PON_MODE`; on a GPON stick it is `1` (as in
   `rootfs/skeleton/etc/config_default_hs.xml`), and `flash set PON_MODE 1`
   puts it back. Setting `PON_DETECT_ENABLE` to 0 stops the rewrite but not
   the detector; a stick still on the factory placeholder serial never runs
   it. Our image is GPON only and never rewrites the PON type.
   [`docs/kb/rtl9601-pondetect-pon-mode-rewrite.md`](kb/rtl9601-pondetect-pon-mode-rewrite.md).
5. **Rebooting every 120 s?** `confirm-arp` left on a stick whose host is
   not on `.2` holds the confirmation back on every boot; remove it
   ([Feature toggles](#switch-files-on-the-config-partition)). An older
   image of ours also rebooted on purpose with `bdgconn-probe` there. A
   committed image of ours that never confirms loops every 120 s: if it is reachable
   inside that window, `echo 1 > /proc/odi_wdt/userland_ok` stops
   this boot's reset, and `nv setenv sw_commit <the other slot>` gets you
   off it.
6. **Both slots unbootable**: the board UART is the only way in. Every rule
   above exists to keep you from here.

## Testing

### The gates

| gate | what it proves | needs |
|---|---|---|
| `make lint` | shellcheck over every script (on-device ones as POSIX `sh`, since busybox ash runs them), the inline-quote check, the private-workspace and vendor-citation greps | `shellcheck`, git |

### Host tests

The kernel drivers are written so that their logic compiles on the host.
Each C test is a **unity build**: `test/odi_switch_test.c` `#include`s
`test/odi_switch_mock.h` and then the driver `.c` files themselves
(`kernel/extra/drivers/net/ethernet/odi/odi_switch_tbl.c`, ...), so the
test runs the same lines the kernel runs. `odi_switch_mock.h` replaces
`odi_reg_read()`/`odi_reg_write()` with a flat register model covering the
switch-core, GPON and counter windows plus a write log; an address outside
every window aborts the test rather than corrupting a slot, and the mock
aborts on a recursive lock or on releasing a lock not held. Kernel-only
code sits behind `#ifdef __KERNEL__`. A new driver file gets a
`test/<name>_test.c` and a `test/<name>_test.sh` wrapper (copy one, it is
five lines), and the wrapper goes into the `test-host` list in the
Makefile.

Tests replay what real sticks did: captured register sequences
(`test/fixtures/`), the committed replay tables in
`rootfs/skeleton/lib/firmware/odi/` (parsed by the C reader and dumped by
the Python writer, so both are checked against the same bytes), a captured
GPON re-activation, and OLT command sequences from both ISPs.

The on-device shell scripts (`apply.sh`, `network.sh`, `flash`, `fwu.sh`,
`fwu_starter.sh`) are tested on the host too: they take their paths from
overridable variables (`ODI_INIT=`, `CONF=`, `IFCONFIG=`, ...), and the
tests point those at FIFOs, stubs and captured `/proc` files. Keep that
shape when you add one.

### test-diag: the exporter contract

`metricsd` sends one fixed batch of commands to `diag` per scrape and
parses the output. The same exporter build also reads the **stock**
firmware's `diag`, so those commands keep the stock syntax and output byte
for byte. `make exporter-test` (inside `test-diag`) runs the batch in
`src/diag/test/exporter.txt` through the real binary under qemu, answered
by a fake hardware layer, and compares the output with
`src/diag/test/exporter.golden` (and once more without the trailing
`exit`). If you change anything the exporter reads, the golden files fail
and you have changed the contract: fix the code, or change the exporter
first. `src/diag/README.md` ("The exporter contract") has the rules.

### Optics model

`test/odi_optics_model.h` (host build only) is a scriptable SFF-8472
transceiver behind the same modelled I2C controller `odi_i2c_test.c` and
`odi_ddm_test.c` already use (`test/odi_switch_mock.h`): two 256-byte pages
(A0h identity, A2h DDMI), the `IO_GPIO_EN`/`PIN_GPIO_SELECT` routing gate
(`docs/kb/dfp34x-optics-on-i2c-port1-gated-by-io-gpio-en.md`) and an
"absent module" mode, both surfaced as I2C NACK exactly the way the real
device does.

To script a scenario in a new test:

1. `odi_mock_reset()`, then `odi_optics_model_reset()` (installs the write
   hook and resets both pages to the isp1 capture's identity strings).
2. `odi_optics_set_a2_word(offset, raw)` for any of the five numeric DDM
   fields (`odi_ddm.c` has the offsets), `odi_optics_set_alarms(alarms,
   warnings, los)` for the alarm/warning bits and the optical LOS status
   bit, `odi_optics_set_present(0)` for an absent module.
3. Write `ODI_SW_PIN_GPIO_SELECT(0)` yourself (`odi_reg_write`) with the
   value `odi_board_optics()` writes at boot, `ODI_OPTICS_GPIO_SELECT_VALUE`
   -- the model does not assume it, so a test can also exercise the
   not-yet-routed NACK path.
4. Drive `odi_i2c_read_bytes()`/`odi_ddm_get()` as usual; a scenario that
   should NACK gets `-ENXIO` back.

Alarm and warning bits are stated directly by the scenario, not derived
from threshold math this repo does not model: a real SFF-8472 module
computes them against its own internal calibration and only exposes the
resulting bits, which is exactly what `ODI_DDM_ALARM_STATUS` reads.
`test/odi_optics_model_test.c` has the routing-gate, absent-module,
rx-power-drift and LOS scenarios end to end; the exporter contract
(above) covers the same three scenarios at the `diag` CLI layer, in
`src/diag/test/hw_fake_rx_drift.c`/`hw_fake_los.c`/`hw_fake_absent.c` and
their own golden files.

The real-hardware `diag` optics readout is not exercised inside
`test-qemu`: that harness boots a stock, generic `qemu-system-mips` malta
kernel for userland-level testing (see its own section below), never our
RTL9602C kernel, so `/dev/odi_sw` and the real `odi_i2c`/`odi_ddm` drivers
do not exist in that guest. The host-side driver tests, the diag readout
test above and the exporter contract are the coverage for this path.

### test-omci

`src/omci/qemu-test.sh`, in the freestanding toolchain image as root
(it creates `/var/config` inside the container). qemu-user cannot open
our own netlink protocol number (`NETLINK_ODI`), so there is no line side:
it injects frames on the message queue, and checks the MIB store, the
45-command CLI protocol and
the dump renderers against output captured from live sticks. Full OLT
sessions are not covered here; they are exercised through the kernel side
in `test/odi_switch_isp2_test.c` and on hardware.

### test-qemu: the real rootfs, full system, on a stock kernel

`make busybox packages src releases` first (or `make image` once, which
does all four); then `make test-qemu`, which runs
`test/qemu/build-initramfs.sh` and `test/qemu/run-qemu.sh`.

**What it covers.** The whole busybox init chain -- `inittab`, `rcS`,
`rcS.pon`, the `svc-*.sh` respawn entries -- unmodified, packed as an
initramfs instead of the flashed squashfs+uImage (no block device or MTD
in qemu, and no need to build our own RTL9602C kernel just to boot this):
our tmpfs caps, `oom_score_adj`, busybox init `respawn` and sysctls,
dropbear/confd/metricsd/omcid for real, and
the resilience scenarios from `docs/SETTINGS.md` ("Resilience") -- filling
`/tmp` to `ENOSPC`, an OOM (a busybox-only memory hog, no compiled tool
needed), and `kill -9` on each critical daemon, checked over real ssh
(a test-only key, `test/qemu/id_test`, baked into the harness's initramfs
only) and real HTTP to confd and metricsd. `svc-syslogd.sh`/`svc-klogd.sh`
run here too (unconditionally); `svc-ntpd.sh` is exercised against
`NTP_SERVER`, a fixture value the harness writes straight to
`/var/config/lastgood.xml` (there is no real config partition here either)
pointing at 10.0.2.2, the qemu user-net gateway address SLIRP maps to the
host's own loopback -- `run-qemu.sh` uses the NTP server the build host
already runs on UDP 123 if there is one, otherwise starts a host busybox
`ntpd -l` for the scenario, steps the guest clock to 2000-01-01, restarts
ntpd with `apply.sh ntp` and checks the clock is corrected within 60 s.
No responder on the build host: that one scenario is skipped, logged, not
failed.

**What it does NOT cover**, because the kernel underneath is a STOCK
mainline build (`odi-toolchain-qemu-kernel-malta`, below), never this
repository's own kernel: `kernel/extra`, every `odi_*` driver, the switch,
the GPON MAC, `/proc/odi_init`/`/proc/odi_omci`/`/proc/odi_wdt` -- none of
it exists under qemu. rcS's own fail-open checks (`[ -w /proc/odi_init ]`
and friends) already skip every hardware step cleanly when those are
absent, exactly as they would on any kernel without them, so no
qemu-specific flag or patch to rcS was needed for that part. Two
consequences worth knowing: omcid never starts (nothing this harness can
do about it -- there is no `/proc/odi_omci` to register against), so
`/bin/diag` is swapped for a stub (`test/qemu/diag-stub.sh`, initramfs-only,
never in a flashed image) that answers metricsd's fixed command batch with
`src/diag/test/exporter.golden`, the same fixture `test-diag` checks
byte-for-byte -- so the exporter has real, checkable data to serve; and
none of the odi_wdt watchdog rules (boot confirmation, per-client ping
deadlines, the memory floor) can be exercised end to end here, only that
rcS's client registration and omcid's own ping degrade harmlessly without
`/proc/odi_wdt` -- the rules themselves are host-tested
(`test/odi_wdt_test.c`) against a fake clock instead.

**The kernel image.** `odi-toolchain-qemu-kernel-malta`
(`toolchain/images.env`, pulled like the other two toolchain images) is
linux-6.18.53, `malta_defconfig` plus a small fragment (initramfs,
devtmpfs/tmpfs, pcnet32/virtio-net, and **big-endian** -- `malta_defconfig`
defaults to little-endian, which would refuse to exec this repository's
big-endian binaries), built in the odi-toolchain repository and published
from a `qemu-malta-vN` tag so this repository's CI never has to build a
kernel from source on every run. To rebuild it after a fragment change:
in a checkout of `odi-toolchain`, `make qemu-kernel-malta` (about ten
minutes), then `QEMU_KERNEL_IMAGE=odi-toolchain-qemu-kernel-malta:local
make test-qemu` here to try the local build before tagging a release
there.

**Filesystem/mm parity with `kernel/618/config`.** v1.0.2 through
v1.0.4-rc1 shipped a flashable kernel with neither `CONFIG_SHMEM` nor
`CONFIG_TMPFS` (a capped tmpfs mount silently falls back to a ramfs-backed
stub that rejects `size=`, so `/var` and `/var/tmp` never landed) while
this qemu kernel had `CONFIG_TMPFS` on the whole time -- `test-qemu` never
had a chance to catch the mismatch. `qemu-kernel-malta/config.fragment` (in
`odi-toolchain`) now pins `CONFIG_SHMEM`, `CONFIG_TMPFS`,
`CONFIG_TMPFS_POSIX_ACL`, `CONFIG_MTD` and `CONFIG_JFFS2_FS` explicitly --
the filesystem/mm symbols `rootfs/skeleton/etc/fstab` here actually
depends on -- rather than leaving them to whatever `malta_defconfig`
happens to default to. There is no automated inheritance from
`kernel/618/config` across the two repositories; keeping the fragment a
superset of that file's filesystem/mm block is a by-hand rule, enforced in
practice by `run-qemu.sh`'s fstab-mounts assertion (below), which fails
loudly if a required mount is not the type or size `/etc/fstab` says it
should be. When `kernel/618/config` gains a new filesystem/mm symbol its
runtime behavior depends on, mirror it into the fragment in the same
change and note it here.

**test-qemu asserts the fstab mounts, not just that ssh comes up.** Right
after ssh answers, `run-qemu.sh` reads `/proc/mounts` over ssh and checks
`/var` and `/var/tmp` are both tmpfs at the size `/etc/fstab` configures
(`size=6144k`/`size=8192k` -- the kernel echoes `/etc/fstab`'s `6m`/`8m`
back in KB) -- exactly the assertion that would have caught the
`CONFIG_SHMEM`/`CONFIG_TMPFS` regression above before it ever reached
hardware. It also checks that IF a mount shows up at `/var/config` (this
harness has no MTD device, so normally none does -- "What this does NOT
cover", above), it is a real `jffs2` mount, matching what a flashed image
gets, never something softer that would mask a mismatch.

**Two things this harness needed that a flashed image does not**, both
measured, not guessed, while first bringing qemu-system-mips boots up:
QEMU's `-net user` (SLIRP) hostfwd only delivers packets to a guest
address within SLIRP's OWN subnet (`10.0.2.0/24` by default) -- the
device's real static default (`192.168.1.1`, outside that subnet) never
received a single forwarded packet, even with a custom `net=`/`host=`
override on the qemu command line, while the plain default subnet worked
immediately; `run-qemu.sh` addresses the box at `10.0.2.15` through
`network.sh`'s own `/etc/config/lan-ip` override, applied from `rcS.dev`'s
`dev_hook` (wrapped, not replaced -- see `test/qemu/build-initramfs.sh`).
And `CONFIG_DEVTMPFS_MOUNT`'s automatic `/dev` populate only runs on the
normal root-mount path, which a pure initramfs boot (`-initrd` +
`rdinit=`, no `root=`) skips entirely -- without a `mount -t devtmpfs
devtmpfs /dev` first, `/dev/null`, `/dev/console`, `/dev/kmsg` and
`/dev/urandom` do not exist, and a shell redirection like `> /dev/kmsg`
then silently CREATES them as empty regular files instead of erroring,
which is a very quiet way to lose every `crumb` and have dropbear key
generation and `seedrng` look like they succeeded while writing into fake
files. The harness's `/init` (its only rootfs addition that is not "the
real rootfs, unmodified" -- one `mount` then `exec /sbin/init`) fixes this
before the real `rcS` ever runs.

### Manual harnesses

Under `test/`, not in any make target, each with its requirements in its
header: `fwu_stock_commands_test.sh` and `fwu_stock_flash_test.sh` (does
`fwu.sh` run on the stock image's busybox 1.12.4 with 52 applets, and
flash for real), `image_tar_format_test.sh` (can that busybox's `tar` read
our tarball), `rootfs_chroot_test.sh` (the boot scripts in a qemu-user
chroot of the staged rootfs), `uimage_header_test.sh` (the header U-Boot
reads). Run them when you touch `fwu.sh`, the tarball, or rcS.

### Pure refactors: prove the machine code did not change

A change that should not change behaviour (a comment pass, a rename, a
header move, a dead `#if` arm removed) is proven by the disassembly, not by
a trial:

    dis() {   # disassemble build/kernel-618/vmlinux with the toolchain objdump
        docker run --rm -v "$PWD/build/kernel-618:/k:ro" \
            "$(packages/oss-env.sh)" mips-linux-uclibc-objdump -d /k/vmlinux | tail -n +3
    }
    git checkout <base>;   VERSION=cmp COMPILE_ONLY=1 kernel/build.sh && dis > before.s
    git checkout <branch>; VERSION=cmp COMPILE_ONLY=1 kernel/build.sh && dis > after.s
    diff before.s after.s && echo identical

Pin `VERSION` so the ramlog build id string is the same in both builds.
An empty diff means the change is a no-op for the CPU; say so in the
commit message. For a file split or move, where addresses shift, compare
per function with the addresses normalised: every non-static function
identical, each static-inlining difference named. The same works for a
userland binary (`omcid`, `diag`) with its own objdump. `tools/kernel-footprint.sh`
before and after shows what a patch change costs the next LTS port.

### On hardware

Only on a stick you own and can power-cycle, with the stock firmware
committed in the other slot. The ISPs' OLTs differ in how they provision,
so a change to OMCI or the datapath needs a trial on a live line, not only
on a bench fibre.

- **A trial boot**: flash the inactive slot, `nv setenv sw_tryactive
  <slot>`, `reboot` (`docs/FLASHING.md`). Check: `/proc/cmdline` shows the
  trial slot, `cat /proc/odi_wdt/userland_ok` says `userland_ok=1`,
  `omcli state` reaches O5 with the services provisioned, `dmesg` has no
  new warning, `/etc/odi-build` names your build.
- **A boot loop**: repeat the trial from the committed image, one
  `sw_tryactive` per boot, and record each boot (ramlog counter, time to
  confirm, ONU state). The releases are qualified with 15 consecutive
  trials; bugs that live in the boot (the NIC DMA one hit one boot in six)
  need that many.
- **A soak**: hours with a sample every few minutes: ONU state, the switch
  MIB counters (`diag mib dump counter port all`), `ip -s link` errors,
  `dmesg`, `MemFree`, the exporter's scrape. **Subscriber traffic is
  forwarded by the switch hardware and never reaches the CPU**
  ([`docs/kb/rtl9601-forwarding-visibility.md`](kb/rtl9601-forwarding-visibility.md)),
  so a busy line exercises the switch and the GPON MAC but not `odi_nic`.
  To test the NIC path, send traffic to the stick itself: copy a file of a
  few MB to it and back over scp and compare checksums, in every sample.

## Gotchas

Each of these has cost real time. The pointer says where the evidence is.

**Hardware and boot**

- **No serial console.** The UART exists on the board, not on the SFP edge.
  Everything about debugging here goes through the ramlog, crumbs and
  breadcrumbs ([above](#reading-a-boot-you-could-not-see)), and every boot
  change goes through a trial.
- **The loader leaves the NIC DMA running.** The CPU-port NIC's receive
  engine keeps writing frames through the loader's descriptors into pages
  Linux has handed out; the symptom was a SIGBUS in `/bin/busybox` about one
  boot in six. `prom_init()` stops it with two uncached stores before the
  kernel owns a page. Do not move that later. `docs/KERNEL.md` "The board".
- **The RLX5281 needs the R3000 exception model.** It keeps CP0 `Status` as
  a KU/IE stack and returns with `rfe`; the kernel is `CONFIG_CPU_R3000`,
  and `objdump -d vmlinux | grep -cw eret` must print 0. The CPU also has
  to be named in the R3K probe (PRId `0x0000dc02`), or a `BUG_ON()` runs
  `break` before any exception vector exists: a silent hang.
  [`docs/kb/rtl9602c-rlx5281-kernel-needs-r3000-exception-model.md`](kb/rtl9602c-rlx5281-kernel-needs-r3000-exception-model.md).
- **The icache does not snoop the dcache**, and how it is indexed is
  unknown, so a per-line invalidate cannot be trusted to hit every alias.
  `flush_data_cache_page()` writes the dcache back and invalidates the
  **whole** icache. Any new path that gives a page new contents for
  execution has to end there. `docs/KERNEL.md` "The CPU".
- **`wmb()` is nothing on this build.** `CPU_R3000` turns `CPU_HAS_SYNC`
  off, so mainline `wmb()`, `rmb()` and `dma_wmb()` emit no instruction. Use
  `rtl8686_sync()` (`asm/mach-rtl8686/rtl8686-barrier.h`) for DMA ordering
  (a descriptor body before its ownership bit). `docs/KERNEL.md` "The CPU".
- **There is no clocksource.** No CP0 Count/Compare and no free-running
  counter; timekeeping is the jiffies clocksource, advanced by the TIMER0
  tick interrupt. With interrupts off, `jiffies` and `ktime_get()` stand
  still, so a poll bounded by a clock in atomic context never times out.
  `odi_poll_reg()` (`odi_switch_reg.h`) is built on 6.18
  `read_poll_timeout_atomic()`, which counts its bound in delay steps
  rather than reading a clock; use it, or count iterations yourself.
  `kernel/extra/arch/mips/rtl8686/time.c`.
- **Reading an undecoded SoC address stalls the bus** until the watchdog
  resets the stick. Do not probe with `devmem` or `memprobe` outside
  addresses you can account for; the drivers bound every MMIO access
  (`odi_switch_mmio_offset_in_bounds()`).
  [`docs/kb/rtl9602c-undecoded-address-read-takes-the-stick-down.md`](kb/rtl9602c-undecoded-address-read-takes-the-stick-down.md).
- **The kernel partition is 1,359,872 bytes** (the LZMA uImage), and
  `image/build.sh` refuses a bigger one. The config is on a diet (no
  modules, no kallsyms, `SLUB_TINY`, a list of unreachable syscalls off).
  Before turning an option off, map it to every syscall it removes and
  scan the rootfs ELFs for the o32 number (4000 + N) loaded before
  `syscall`. Three must stay on: `POSIX_TIMERS` (on 6.18 it also builds
  `itimer.c`; off, `alarm`/`setitimer` return ENOSYS and busybox `arping`,
  `ping` and `timeout` never time out, which rcS depends on),
  `FILE_LOCKING` (busybox `flock`, iproute2, and `fcntl` locks a scan
  cannot see) and `VM_EVENT_COUNTERS` (the exporter's memory pressure
  signal). `docs/KERNEL.md` "The config".
- **Squashfs is XZ with 256 KiB blocks.** Mainline squashfs has no LZMA
  (the stock image's format), and 6.18 keeps caches of whole blocks, so
  the block size is RAM on a 32 MB board.
  [`docs/kb/rtl9602c-squashfs-block-size-costs-ram.md`](kb/rtl9602c-squashfs-block-size-costs-ram.md).
- **The L2 table's valid signal is the HIT bit of TABLE_STATUS after the
  read**, not the row's valid bit (bit 77 reads back set on every row). A
  hash *write* also reports HIT for an absent key, so a delete looks the key
  up with a hash *read* first. `docs/KERNEL.md` "The L2 table".

**Instruction set and ABI**

- **The CPU traps on instructions a normal MIPS toolchain emits**: `mul`,
  `clz` (all of SPECIAL2), `teq`/`tne`/`tge`/`tlt` and their forms, and the
  branch-likely `beql`/`bnel`. Every build uses `-march=mips2
  -mno-branch-likely -mdivide-breaks`, including the toolchain's own target
  libraries, and every ELF in the image passes `packages/isa-audit.sh` (a
  deny list) and `packages/isa-allowlist.sh` (only mnemonics confirmed on
  the device). Run both on anything you build yourself. The kernel adds
  `-U_MIPS_ISA -D_MIPS_ISA=_MIPS_ISA_MIPS1` so `BUG_ON()` does not become
  `tne`. [`docs/CROSS-COMPILING.md`](CROSS-COMPILING.md),
  [`docs/kb/rtl9601-isa-map.md`](kb/rtl9601-isa-map.md).
- **MIPS o32 is not the generic Linux ABI**, and every difference fails
  silently. Syscalls are numbered from 4000 (`exit` is 4001), and an error
  comes back in `$a3`, not as a negative return. `struct sigaction` has
  `sa_flags` first. `SOCK_STREAM` is 2 and `SOCK_DGRAM` 1 (swapped),
  `SOL_SOCKET` is `0xffff`. errno values differ (`ETIMEDOUT` is 145,
  `EIDRM` 36). The ioctl direction bits sit elsewhere (a write is
  `0x80000000`). Take every constant from the MIPS `<asm/*.h>` headers,
  never from another architecture. `src/diag/src/sys.h` has the ones our
  tools use. [`docs/kb/mips-o32-syscall-abi-traps.md`](kb/mips-o32-syscall-abi-traps.md).
- **Two build styles.** Everything in `src/` is freestanding (`-nostdlib`,
  our own `_start` and syscall layer, built with Debian's
  `gcc-mips-linux-gnu` at `-march=mips1`), which also makes it run on the
  stock image. Everything in `packages/` links statically against our
  uClibc-ng; the builds refuse a binary with a `PT_INTERP`. There are no
  shared libraries in the image.
  [`docs/kb/rtl9601-freestanding-over-libc.md`](kb/rtl9601-freestanding-over-libc.md).

**Userland and data**

- **The config store is shared with the stock firmware.** The jffs2
  `config` partition is not part of a slot: both images read it, and a
  reflash never touches it. Of its 184 keys this image reads 21; the UI
  shows the rest read-only. **Never delete a key** this image does not use
  (the stock slot still reads it), never erase the partition (it holds the
  serial number and MAC the line authenticates on), and keep backups whole.
  `docs/SETTINGS.md`, [`docs/kb/rtl9601-config-store.md`](kb/rtl9601-config-store.md).
- **Every setting has an apply class**: LIVE, SERVICE RESTART, INTERRUPTS
  INTERNET, REBOOT. A new setting needs its class decided, the apply path
  (`apply.sh network` or `apply.sh omci`, or a reboot), the odi-ui schema
  row and the `docs/SETTINGS.md` row, together.
- **The exporter contract.** The `diag` commands `metricsd` sends keep the
  stock CLI's syntax and output byte for byte; `make test-diag` pins them.
  `/proc/odi_gpon` and anything else the exporter or confd parses are
  interfaces too.
- **`diag` waits forever on a stdin that never closes.** Give it a pipe or a
  file, and `timeout` in anything that must not stall (rcS, network.sh).
- **`omcicli get tables` wedges the stock OMCI daemon.** Ours answers it; do
  not run it on the stock slot. `omcicap` and `omciprobe -f` interfere with
  a running `omcid` (`docs/TOOLS.md`).
- **Daemons are `respawn` entries, not sessions.** metricsd, confd,
  dropbear and omcid are forked by busybox init itself and restarted the
  instant one exits; `kill` alone brings a new one back within seconds, no
  `setsid` needed any more (`docs/TOOLS.md` "Restarting a daemon"). Use
  `/etc/init.d/services stop <name>` to keep one down across restarts.
- **`/var` is RAM.** Every log is gone at reboot; only the ramlog and the
  breadcrumbs survive.

**Repo rules**

- **No apostrophes in shell comments.** Several scripts run a block as
  `docker run ... bash -c '...'`, where the whole block is one
  single-quoted word; an apostrophe in a comment inside it ends the word,
  and the rest of the block runs in the outer shell. Rephrase ("the kernel
  own config", "does not"), do not escape. `tools/check-inline-quotes.sh`
  checks inline blocks; avoid them everywhere.
- **No vendor-sourced code, and no vendor source file or function names**
  in code, comments or docs. Describing what the stock firmware *does*, as a
  black box (its shipped binaries, their exported symbols, what it writes),
  is fine and often necessary. `make lint` greps for a narrow list of known
  vendor source citations; the review catches the rest. `AGENTS.md`.
- **No private references.** `make lint` greps tracked files for paths and
  document names of the private workspace this project grew up beside, and
  for home-directory paths. It greps only **tracked** files, so `git add`
  a new file before you trust a clean lint. Name the test sticks by their
  line, ISP1 and ISP2, and never commit a credential, serial number or MAC
  from a real stick.
- **Comments say what is true now.** The why, in the fewest lines that
  carry it: an invariant, a hardware fact, an ordering or lock rule, what
  a magic value means or that it is not decoded, and where the evidence
  is (a fixture, a test, a docs anchor). No trial or boot ids, dates, old
  patch numbers or "used to": git history is the record, and the commit
  body is where a finding goes. `make lint` greps `kernel/extra`,
  `rootfs/skeleton` and `src` for the common markers. Derivations belong
  in `docs/` (`docs/SWITCH.md`, `docs/KERNEL.md`, `docs/BOOT.md`).
- **Mainline footprint.** `kernel/618/patches/` is only for lines in files
  mainline already has; new files go in `kernel/extra/`. Fold a fix into
  the patch it belongs to. `tools/kernel-footprint.sh` only goes down
  without a stated reason.
- **Builds are not bit-reproducible**: the kernel's version string, the
  ramlog build id and the image manifest embed the build time and version.
  Two builds of one tree are equivalent, not identical; compare
  disassembly, not files.

## Feature toggles

Every switch, parameter and build variable, from the code on `k618`. The
**class** column says who it is for: *prod* (a supported setting) or *dev*
(a development aid, safe but not for a production stick).
`docs/SETTINGS.md` remains the user-facing description of the switch files
a user may set; this table adds where each one is read.

Line numbers are for `k618` at the time of writing and drift; grep for the
name.

### Switch files on the config partition

`/etc/config` is a symlink to `/var/config`, the jffs2 config partition; a
file there survives reflashing and applies to every later image. All are
read at boot unless stated. rcS paths are
`rootfs/skeleton/etc/init.d/rcS`.

| file | read at | effect | default | class |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `dropbear.off`, `confd.off`, `metricsd.off` | `etc/init.d/services:40`, `:31`, `:28` | that daemon is not started | absent: all three run | prod |
| `lan-ip` | `etc/scripts/network.sh:48` | management address, one line; overrides `LAN_IP_ADDR`, netmask then 255.255.255.0; live with `apply.sh network` | absent: `LAN_IP_ADDR`, else 192.168.1.1/24 | prod |
| `sds.off` | `network.sh:242` | skip the host SerDes check and fix | absent | prod (escape hatch) |
| `optics.off` | rcS, before `pon_steps` | skip the `optics` verb, `PIN_GPIO_SELECT` and the laser TX enable (GPIO 13): **laser off, no service** | absent | prod (escape hatch) |
| `modules.off` | rcS `:191`; `etc/scripts/apply.sh:42` | skip the switch init (platform settings and module-load replay) and `omcid`: **no OMCI**; `apply.sh omci` refuses | absent | prod (escape hatch) |
| `pon-steps` | `etc/init.d/rcS.dev:184` | replaces the built-in PON steps: one verb per line, or `omcimods`, `gponsn auto`, `gponpw auto` (`docs/BOOT.md`); a wrong list means no PON | absent | dev |
| `omci-identity.on` | `src/omci/respond/omcid.h:318`, loaded `cfgstore.c:645` | omcid reports the OLT identity keys (`OMCI_SW_VER1/2`, `GPON_ONU_MODEL`, ...); `apply.sh omci` | absent: built-in values | prod |
| `breadcrumbs.on` | `rcS.dev:26`, `:52`, `:61`, `:75`, `:86`, `:105`; `services:70` | boot crumbs to `breadcrumbs`, `trial-diag.txt`, a 30 s heartbeat to the kernel log, soft-lockup 20 s and hung-task 30 s | absent | dev |
| `confirm-arp` | `rcS.dev:165` | confirm the watchdog only after an ARP reply from `.2` of `br0`; **resets every 120 s if the host is elsewhere** | absent: confirm unconditionally | dev |
| `confd.auth`, `confd/`, `dropbear.d/authorized_keys` | confd (odi-ui); dropbear via `services:60` (`-D`) | UI credential, UI overrides, root SSH keys | admin/admin; image assets; none | prod |

State files, not switches: `seedrng/` (entropy seed, rcS `:56`),
`dropbear.d/ed25519` (host key, generated on first boot), `breadcrumbs`,
`trial-diag.txt` (outputs of the dev rows).
Settings in the XML store itself (`lastgood.xml`, `lastgood_hs.xml`) are
`docs/SETTINGS.md`.

### Kernel parameters and the command line

Built-in drivers take parameters as `<object>.<name>=` on the command
line, or at run time through `/sys/module/<object>/parameters/<name>`. The
command line is `CONFIG_CMDLINE` (`kernel/618/config:65`) followed by
U-Boot's per-slot `argv` (`MIPS_CMDLINE_BUILTIN_EXTEND`), so a parameter
added to `CONFIG_CMDLINE` takes effect after a kernel rebuild; U-Boot's
`root=` and `mtdparts=` win because they come last.

| parameter | defined | effect | default | when | class |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `odi_nic.debug` | `odi_nic.c:51` (bool, 0644) | trace the first interrupts and RX descriptors to the console; at the first open (so only when set on the command line) also the ring register read-backs and a NIC state dump 15 s and 45 s later | off | boot, or live for the traces | dev |
| `print-fatal-signals=1` | `kernel/618/config:65` (mainline) | register dump of any process killed by SIGSEGV/SIGBUS/SIGILL, into the ramlog | on | boot | prod (debug aid) |

### Kconfig

Our symbols; the seed config (`kernel/618/config`) sets each one. The
four driver symbols sit in one menu that depends on `MACH_RTL8686`
(`olddefconfig` silently drops a symbol whose dependency is off; the build
prints the `CONFIG_ODI_*` it got).

| symbol | defined | builds | seed | class |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MACH_RTL8686` | `kernel/618/patches/0002` | the board (System type) | y | prod |
| `RTL8686_UART0`, `RTL8686_NOR` | `arch/mips/rtl8686/Kconfig:32`, `:39` | the 8250 UART; the SPI NOR MTD driver | y | prod |
| `ODI_EARLY_CRUMBS` | `arch/mips/rtl8686/Kconfig:52` | the early boot crumbs in the ramlog pages | y (Kconfig default n) | prod (debug aid) |
| `ODI_NIC` | `drivers/net/ethernet/odi/Kconfig:5` | `odi_nic.c`, the CPU-port NIC | y | prod |
| `ODI_SWITCH` | `:12` | the switch core, the OMCI transport and `/proc/odi_omci`, the GPON MAC and the switch interrupt, `/proc/odi_init` and the SDK-init replay, the board-init replay, `/dev/odi_sw` and I2C/DDM (selects `FW_LOADER`, `CRC32`) | y | prod |
| `ODI_WDT` | `:26` | the watchdog kicker, the userland deadline and the restart handler | y | prod |
| `ODI_RAMLOG` | `:34` | the DRAM ramlog console and `/proc/odi_ramlog_prev*` | y | prod |

### Build variables

### /proc and /dev control files

Writing any of these by hand reprograms hardware under a running stack; do
it on a trial stick only. `docs/TOOLS.md` "Kernel control files" has the
read side.

| file | defined | write | read | class |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/proc/odi_init` | `odi_init.c` | one verb, optional argument: the SDK-init verbs (`intr` ... `ponmac`, `i2c`, `i2cen`, `gpon`, `rxsd`), `optics`, and the GPON verbs (`gpondrv`, `gpondev`, `gponsn <sn>`, `gponpw <hex>`, `gponact`, `gpondeact`, `gponstat`) | the last verb's return code | prod (`rtk_init` under the stock firmware) |
| `/proc/odi_omci` | `odi_omci.c:451` | `switch_init` (`:398`): the platform settings and the module-load replay | redirect registrations and pids, frame and command counters | prod |
| `/proc/odi_wdt/userland_ok` | `odi_wdt.c:533` | `1`: userland is up, cancel the 120 s reset | `userland_ok=N deadline=120 uptime=N` | prod (`luna_watchdog` under the stock firmware) |
| `/proc/odi_wdt/watchdog_flag` | `odi_wdt.c:488` | `1` arm and kick; `0` disable the watchdog and stop the kicker | `watchdog_flag=N` | dev |
| `/proc/odi_wdt/register` | `odi_wdt.c:597` | `"<name> <deadline_s>"`: register or update a watchdog client (rcS does this once per client at boot) | -- | prod |
| `/proc/odi_wdt/ping` | `odi_wdt.c:625` | `"<name>"`: a registered client's own ping; arms its deadline on the first call | -- | prod (omcid, every 15 s: `src/omci/respond/main.c`, `wdt_ping()`) |
| `/proc/odi_wdt/clients` | `odi_wdt.c:648` | none | one line per client: `name=... deadline=... armed=... last_ping_age=...` | dev (debugging) |
| `/proc/odi_gpon` | `odi_gpon.c:786` | none | ONU state, ONU id, PLOAM counters, serial | prod (`diag` reads it for the exporter; its format is an interface) |
| `/proc/odi_ramlog_prev`, `_raw` | `odi_ramlog.c:483` | none | the previous boot's ramlog (root only) | prod (debug aid) |
| `/dev/odi_sw` | `odi_reg.c:191` | ioctls `REG_SET`, `L2_MC_ADD`/`DEL` | ioctls `REG_GET`, `MIB_GET`, `DDM_GET`, `L2_GET`/`NEXT`, `L2_MODE` (`odi_reg.h:118`) | prod |

The `odi_omci` netlink transport rides on its own private protocol number
(`NETLINK_ODI`; the stock firmware used `NETLINK_USERSOCK`) and refuses
senders without `CAP_NET_ADMIN`.

## Making a change

1. **Read first.** The file's header and the section of `docs/KERNEL.md`,
   `docs/TOOLS.md` or the driver README that covers it; `docs/kb/` for the
   hardware; `git log -p` for the file, since the commit bodies carry the
   reasoning.
2. **Small commits, one change each**, subject `area: what changed`
   (`odi_switch_l2: ...`, `rcS: ...`, `docs: ...`), a body that says why and
   what was measured. Sign them if you can (`git commit -S`; the
   maintainer signs with an SSH key). No `Signed-off-by:` in the kernel
   patch files (`docs/KERNEL.md` says why).
3. **Run the gates**: `make test` always; the kernel build, the ISA audit
   and the footprint for a kernel change; the image build for anything that
   ships; the disassembly diff for a refactor. Put the evidence in the
   commit body.
4. **Trial it on your own stick**, never on one carrying someone's only
   connection: stock committed in the other slot, `: >
   /etc/config/breadcrumbs.on` first, `confirm-arp` if your host sits on
   `.2`, `sw_tryactive`, never `sw_commit`. Record what you saw.
5. **Update the docs in the same change**: `docs/SETTINGS.md` for a
   setting, `docs/TOOLS.md` for a command, `docs/KERNEL.md` for a driver,
   this file for a toggle or a trap, `CHANGELOG.md` when a release is cut.
6. **Write down what you learned about the hardware** as a field note in
   `docs/kb/`: one claim per note, a title that states the claim, a
   one-paragraph summary, `*Last verified: <date>*`, then `## What`, `##
   Why it matters`, `## Evidence` (what was run, on which line, what came
   back) and `## See also`. Only what was observed or reproduced goes in; a
   hypothesis stays in the commit message or the issue. Add the note to
   the table in `docs/kb/README.md` by hand. Describe the stock firmware
   by its behaviour, never by its source.

[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) has the short version, and how to
