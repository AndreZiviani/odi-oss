# What runs without a stick. test-host needs only bash and the repo (the flash
# accessor against a sample store, the fwu.sh guards against captured /proc
# files); test-omci builds our binaries and drives omcid under qemu-user in the
# diag toolchain container (src/omci/qemu-test.sh, about 130 checks). The
# QEMU system harnesses under test/ that need a staged rootfs or a built kernel
# stay manual; each says so in its header.
#
# The legs of `make test` -- lint, test-host, test-diag and one per OMCI suite
# -- run side by side (tools/test-legs.sh, which says why that is not `make
# -j`): each is its own docker container or its own host process and writes
# nothing in common (the OMCI suites keep /tmp, /var/config and the SysV queues
# inside their container; a failed one leaves its daemon log in out/test-logs/).
# A leg prints one line when it ends, and its whole output only when it
# failed, so parallel output is never interleaved. All legs finish when one
# fails, so a run reports every failure, and `make test` exits non-zero when
# any did. TEST_JOBS is the number of legs at once (default: the CPUs);
# `make test TEST_JOBS=1` runs them one by one. `make test-<leg>` runs one leg
# on its own, its output streaming.

# drv-test.sh is the driver-call golden, against a test build of omcid.
# resume-test.sh replays that same golden across a kill -9 and respawn:
# the resumed instance's MIB and switch bookkeeping must come back
# identical, with zero driver calls. swdl-test.sh runs a whole OLT software
# download, activate and commit in both OLT_SW_DOWNLOAD modes, under
# qemu -strace, and asserts nothing opens /dev/mtd, execs or reboots.
# vlan-test.sh builds both ISP sessions with the manual tag on and off
# (transparent) and checks the bridge rules.
# One target per suite (test-omci-<suite>) so CI can run them as parallel
# jobs; test-omci runs them all side by side, as `make test` does (see there).
# Each suite needs only omcli and omcid (plus its drvtrace build), which
# test-omci-build makes: the rest of src/ is built by `make src`. The suites
# share src/omci/testlib.sh: bounded waits for the line a check needs, and a
# SIGTERM to stop the daemon instead of waiting out its idle exit.
